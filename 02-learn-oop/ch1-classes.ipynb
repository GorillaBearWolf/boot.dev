    "# What is object-oriented programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented programming, or \"OOP\" for short, is a way of writing code that relies on the concepts of classes and objects. The main benefit of writing your code in an object-oriented way is to structure your program into simple, reusable pieces of code.\n",
    "In this course, we'll be coding the pieces of a real-time strategy game called \"Age of Dragons\". Players will control armies of men, elves, orcs and dragons as they fight with one another online. If you're familiar with Age of Empires, WarCraft, or StarCraft, it will be something like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment\n",

    "Your manager has noticed that there's a lot of repetitive code in the \"Age of Dragons\" code base. She has tasked you with reworking the fight_soldiers function so that the DPS (damage-per-second) calculation logic is only written once.\n",

    "Notice how these two lines are practically identical:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```py\n",
